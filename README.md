 HLivePHPJS - Live PHP & Javascript Compiler
 This tiny php script allows you to test your php code on the browser without need of 
 creating php files in your local server. Download it and extract it somewhere in your
 web server and you are ready to go. 
 
 You can also do javascript testings within this app. remember the <?php ?> tags are important. 
 
 I have used PHP, HTML5, Javascript and JQuery on this. 
 
 The other plugins and free tools used are:
 AceEditor.
 Hack Typeface.
 Bootstrap.

 Thank you for checking this out. 
 Hope you enjoy it ;)
